Description: This package provides the user with area-weighted mean particulate
    matter values for geographies at a given level as a CSV file. Combining 
    shapefiles from 'tigris' and raster files from Washington University's 
    Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group, functions make it possible to chose 
    among national, state, county, and city level pulls of particulate matter 
    data. Years 2014 thru 2018 of data are pre-available within the package, but
    it is possible to pull data from as far back as 2000.
